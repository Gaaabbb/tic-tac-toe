## :left_speech_bubble: Reflection
There are a lot of new knowledges and experiences that I gained in making this project, such as factory functions, public and private variables and functions, IIFE, and modules. I also got to learn about an important concept called closure and gained a deeper understanding of how scopes work in JavaScript. Besides learning new concepts, I also got to improve my CSS skills and organize my program properly as well. This project proved to be difficult for me because I had a hard time grasping the idea of how factory functions and modules work, and as a result, I went through lots of fruitless solutions, overwhelming experiences, and constant failures, which is why I took a long time completing this project. However, I wouldn't let that bother me because I know that these experiences will serve as a stepping stone for me to improve my skills. Overall, I'm proud of this project and I'm very happy with the outcome as well.
